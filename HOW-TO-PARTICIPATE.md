# How to Participate
### Witness. Document. Amplify.

You don't need a platform, a title, or anyone's permission to contribute to this. What you need is the willingness to act within whatever sphere of influence you already have.

## If You Are a Creator

Look through the [creator list](CREATORS.md). Find someone doing complementary work in another country. Reach out. Start a conversation. You don't need a formal collaboration proposal. A simple "I've been following your work and I think we should talk" is enough to start something real.

Some starting points:

- **Cross-border interviews.** An American legal observer in conversation with an Australian satirist. A Canadian journalist interviewing a US food sovereignty activist. Outside perspectives asking inside questions, and vice versa.
- **Amplification.** Share each other's content with your own audiences. A creator in New Zealand reaching 50,000 people who have never heard an American grassroots voice is more valuable than another share within the same domestic bubble.
- **Collaborative documentation.** Build a shared record of what is happening. International platforms may be more resilient to domestic pressure than US-based ones. A documented record that lives outside US jurisdiction matters.
- **Unfiltered perspective.** Tell American audiences honestly and directly what the rest of the world sees. No diplomatic softening. This cuts through the gaslighting in ways that domestic voices often cannot.

However you participate, the same standards apply: accuracy over speed, documentation over assertion, community-building over outrage. The algorithm rewards the most inflammatory content. We are trying to build something more durable than that.

## If You Are Not a Creator

This is where the network actually grows. You are the connective tissue.

This network follows the same model as community resilience efforts already happening across the US. In Appalachia, in rural communities, in neighborhoods where federal institutions have failed or disappeared, networks work because ordinary people show up, make introductions, share resources, and bear witness to what is happening around them. You don't need a platform to do that. You need the willingness to act within the sphere of influence you already have.

**Find the voices you already trust.** Think about the creators, journalists, podcasters, or community figures you follow who are doing honest, grounded work on any of these issues: political, ecological, cultural, legal. They don't have to be famous. They just have to be real.

**Point them here.** Share this project with them directly. A DM, a comment, an email. Tell them why you think they belong in this conversation and who on the list you think they should know about. One introduction can start something that neither party would have found on their own.

**Nominate them.** If you think someone belongs on the creator list, [submit a nomination](https://amateurethicist.com/nominate). Tell us who they are, what they do, and why they fit.

**Amplify what already exists.** Share content from creators on this list across your own networks. Translate it if you can. Subtitle it if you have the skills. Make it travel further than it would on its own.

## A Note on Safety

Participating in this network is not without risk, and it's important to be clear-eyed about that.

- Data sharing between major social media platforms and government agencies is already occurring in the US. Assume that public content is not private.
- Creators outside the US who speak critically about what is happening there have reported concerns about travel restrictions and other risks.
- If you are inside the US and documenting abuses, particularly around detention, deportation, or law enforcement conduct, understand your rights before you act and connect with legal observers where possible.

Know your own risk tolerance. Take the precautions that make sense for your situation. Don't let fear stop you from participating, but don't be naive about the landscape either.

## The Four Priorities, In Practice

If you're not sure where to start, use these as a guide:

**Boycott.** Economic pressure is already working. Make it visible. Talk about it publicly. Encourage your networks to participate and to document it.

**Document & Dialog.** Connect people who are witnessing what is happening with platforms that can amplify and preserve what they've seen. Help build a record that can't be suppressed.

**Unfiltered Perspective.** Actively seek out and share international voices speaking honestly about what they see happening in America. Push this content into US-based networks where it can do the most good.

**Show Life Elsewhere.** Share what functioning, accountable governance actually looks like to live inside. This isn't gloating. It's evidence that another way is possible, and that it exists right now, in real places, for real people.

*No one is coming to save anyone. But people can witness, document, and amplify. That is not nothing. It may, in fact, be everything.*
