# What Matters
### Witness. Document. Amplify.

This document has two parts. The first is a taxonomy of what is being documented: the harms, violations, and dismantling of institutions that this network exists to witness and record. The second is an account of what is already proven to work in functioning democracies around the world, evidence that the things Americans are told are impossible are, in fact, just normal.

These two parts belong together. You cannot fully understand what is being lost without knowing what is possible. And you cannot build toward something better without an honest account of what already exists elsewhere, not as utopia, but as ordinary, functioning reality.

This is the work of community witness. It is what resilience networks in Appalachia and elsewhere already understand: documenting what is happening clearly and honestly, and sharing what works, is not passive. It is the foundation of everything that comes next.

## Part One: What Is Being Documented

This is not a checklist. It is a starting point, a framework for understanding the scale and interconnection of what is happening. If you are witnessing something that doesn't fit neatly into these categories, document it anyway.

---

### Constitutional Violations
The US Constitution is not abstract. Its protections are specific, and their erosion is documentable.

- Unlawful detention without due process
- Denial of legal representation and habeas corpus
- Suppression of First Amendment rights: press freedom, right to protest, freedom of speech
- Abuse of executive power beyond constitutional authority
- Politicization of the judiciary
- Voter suppression and electoral interference
- Use of government agencies as instruments of political retaliation

---

### International Law Violations
The United States is a signatory to international agreements that carry legal obligations. Those obligations are being violated.

- Deportation of individuals to countries where they face persecution, in violation of non-refoulement principles
- Treatment of detainees that violates the UN Convention Against Torture
- Detention conditions that violate international humanitarian standards
- Violations of treaty obligations with allied nations
- Use of economic coercion against sovereign states

---

### Documented Harm and Deaths
People are being hurt. People are dying. This needs to be on the record.

- Deaths in immigration detention
- Deaths during enforcement actions
- Harm resulting from denial of medical care, legal aid, or basic services
- Psychological harm to families separated by enforcement actions
- Communities living under conditions of fear and surveillance

---

### Corporate-State Capture
This is not a story about one administration. It is a story about a class of people, transnational, extraordinarily wealthy, operating across borders, who have used democratic institutions as instruments of personal power.

- Billionaire class using government appointments and regulatory agencies for personal financial gain
- Conflict of interest at the highest levels of government, normalized and unpunished
- Corporate capture of regulatory bodies meant to protect the public
- Tax policy engineered to concentrate wealth and defund public institutions
- The Epstein network as a specific, documented thread within this: a transnational infrastructure of blackmail, exploitation, and elite impunity that connects financial, political, and media power across multiple countries. This is not a conspiracy theory. It is an open investigation with documented victims, named perpetrators, and powerful institutions that have so far escaped accountability.

---

### Institutional Dismantling
Democracy depends on institutions that function independently of whoever holds power. Those institutions are being systematically weakened.

- Attacks on judicial independence
- Defunding and politicization of scientific agencies
- Suppression and intimidation of a free press
- Dismantling of oversight bodies and inspector general offices
- Attacks on public education and libraries
- Erosion of electoral integrity and independent election administration
- Capture or intimidation of law enforcement and military leadership

### Media Capture and the Collapse of Journalism

A free press does not disappear all at once. It is acquired.

The consolidation of media ownership into the hands of a small number of extremely wealthy individuals is not a new story. But the speed and scale of what has happened over the past three decades is. In the United States, a handful of billionaires and large corporations now own the majority of television news, print media, and radio. The editorial consequences of that ownership are not always explicit. They don't need to be. Journalists learn what stories get resources, what angles get airtime, and what subjects are quietly discouraged. The self-censorship that results is more effective than any direct order.

The progression is documentable. Fox News demonstrated that a partisan propaganda operation could be commercially viable at scale. Rather than being rejected by the broader media ecosystem, that model was absorbed. Outrage proved profitable. The Overton window shifted. And as ownership consolidated further, the distinction between journalism and content optimized for engagement became harder to find.

This matters to this network for a specific reason. The same people who benefit from the political capture described elsewhere in this document also benefit from media capture. An electorate that cannot access reliable information cannot make informed decisions. A press that will not name what is happening cannot hold power accountable. The two processes, political and media capture, reinforce each other. They are not separate problems.

The journalists who have left mainstream outlets for independent platforms represent something important: the professional ethic is not dead, it is displaced. Independent journalism, international journalism, and creator-driven political commentary are currently doing work that legacy media has largely abandoned. Connecting and amplifying those voices is a core purpose of this network.

One additional dimension deserves naming. Social media algorithms do not accidentally prioritize outrage and conflict. Outrage is engaging, and engagement is the product being sold. Whether this is understood by platform owners as a convenient political side effect or actively cultivated as one, the result is the same: genuine information competes at a structural disadvantage against content designed to provoke. Being conscious of this is not optional for anyone participating in this network. It is the baseline.

### Economic Warfare
Power is also exercised through economic means: against allies, against domestic populations, against anyone who resists.

- Tariffs and trade policy weaponized against allied nations
- Withdrawal from international economic agreements
- Concentration of economic power in the hands of a small class
- Defunding of social programs that sustain ordinary people
- Use of financial systems to punish political opponents

*Document what you witness. Date it. Name it where you safely can. Preserve it on platforms outside US jurisdiction where possible. A documented record is harder to disappear than a memory.*

## Part Two: What Is Already Possible

Americans are frequently told that certain things are impossible: too expensive, too radical, too foreign to the American way of life. This is not true. The following things exist right now, functioning normally, in democracies around the world. They are not utopian. They are not experimental. They are just what other countries do.

---

### Universal Healthcare
In Australia, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Japan, and dozens of other countries, access to healthcare is a right, not a function of employment or wealth. People do not go bankrupt from medical bills. People do not ration insulin. People do not die from treatable conditions because they cannot afford care. These systems are not perfect, but they exist, they function, and their populations are healthier and live longer on average than Americans.

---

### Free or Affordable Higher Education
In Germany, university education is free for all students, including international ones. In Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, higher education is free or heavily subsidized. In France, tuition at public universities is minimal. Young people in these countries begin their adult lives without the crushing debt that has become normalized in the United States. This is not a radical idea. It is a policy choice.

---

### Parental Leave and Worker Protections
In Sweden, parents receive up to 480 days of paid parental leave to share between them. In Canada, up to 18 months. In Germany, up to 14 months. The United States is one of the only wealthy nations in the world with no federally mandated paid parental leave. Worker protections against arbitrary dismissal, for minimum wages that reflect the cost of living, for the right to organize, are substantially stronger across most of the developed world.

---

### Press Freedom
Countries like Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden consistently rank at the top of global press freedom indices. A free press is not just an abstract value. It is a functional safeguard against the abuse of power. When governments cannot control the press, corruption is harder to hide.

---

### Gun Policy That Works
Australia introduced strict gun control following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. There has not been a mass shooting in Australia since. New Zealand responded similarly after Christchurch in 2019. These are not distant historical examples. They are recent, documented, deliberate policy choices that produced measurable results. The idea that gun violence is an unavoidable feature of modern life is specifically an American myth.

---

### Proportional Representation and Electoral Integrity
Many democracies use electoral systems that produce legislatures reflecting the actual distribution of voter preferences. Independent electoral commissions administer elections without partisan interference. Voting is accessible, and in some countries compulsory. The result is governments that more accurately represent the people who live under them.

---

### Public Media
The BBC, ABC Australia, CBC Canada, NHK Japan, and many others operate as publicly funded broadcasters with editorial independence from government. They are not perfect, but they provide a baseline of public interest journalism that is not dependent on advertising revenue or corporate ownership. The gutting of public media is not inevitable. It is a choice.

---

### Functional Social Safety Nets
Unemployment insurance, housing assistance, food security programs, and mental health services that actually reach people in need: these exist at scale in functioning democracies. Poverty exists everywhere, but the idea that a wealthy society cannot provide basic security for its most vulnerable members is, again, a specifically American myth.

---

### A Note on This List

This is not an argument that other countries are perfect. They are not. Every democracy has its failures, its hypocrisies, its unresolved injustices. But the existence of these systems, functioning, funded, and available to ordinary people, is evidence that the things Americans are told cannot exist already do.

The question is not whether these things are possible. It is why Americans have been convinced they are not.
