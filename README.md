# Witness. Document. Amplify.
### No Filter. No Borders. No Silence.

---

What is happening in the United States right now is not only an American problem. It is the most visible current stage of something larger.

Democratic institutions do not collapse overnight. They are purchased, slowly, by people with enough money to buy legislators, regulators, and media outlets until the institutions stop functioning as checks on anything. This process has played out before, in other countries. The United States watched it happen elsewhere and did not recognize it arriving at home, in part because the media that might have named it was being bought at the same time.

The same class of people who benefit from this process do not stop at one border. A foothold in the most powerful country in the world is not an endpoint. It is a launch point.

This project exists because the people who can still see clearly need to find each other across borders. No government is coming to fix this. But witnesses can document it. Communities can connect. And the record, honestly kept, is harder to disappear than any single institution.

## What This Is

An open, international network of creators, journalists, commentators, legal observers, satirists, and ordinary people who believe that:

- **Sunlight is the best disinfectant.** Document what is happening, clearly and without spin.
- **Outside perspectives cut through the fog.** International voices can say what domestic voices cannot, and reach audiences that domestic voices cannot reach.
- **Amplification is action.** You don't have to be a creator to participate. Find the voices doing this work and push them further into the world.
- **This is a shared problem.** The erosion of democratic norms, the concentration of power in the hands of a small oligarchic class, and the weaponization of government institutions against ordinary people are not uniquely American phenomena. They require an international response.
- **Community over algorithm.** This is not outrage content. It is not designed to generate clicks or feed engagement metrics. It is designed to connect people, build trust, and create a record. That requires accuracy, honesty, and communication that invites rather than inflames.

## A Groundswell, Not a Campaign

Something important is already happening. This network is part of it, not leading it.

As federal institutions have failed or been weaponized, communities across the United States have been quietly building alternatives. In Appalachia and beyond, organizations like Reimagine Appalachia and Coalfield Development are weaving networks of mutual aid and local resilience. They share resources, skills, and knowledge across county lines without waiting for permission from above.

This network extends that same instinct across borders. Hyper-local and international are not opposites. A community witnessing its own reality clearly and honestly, then connecting that witness to others doing the same thing elsewhere: that is how groundswells work. That is what this is.

## Four Priorities

**1. Boycott**
Economic pressure is already working. Continue it. Expand it. Make it visible.

**2. Document & Dialog**
Connect American voices on the ground with international platforms willing to amplify them. Build a record that cannot be suppressed. International platforms may be more resilient to domestic pressure than US-based ones.

**3. Unfiltered International Perspective**
Tell Americans what the rest of the world sees when it looks at what is happening. Clearly, honestly, without diplomatic softening. This breaks through the gaslighting. It matters more than most people realize.

**4. Show Life Elsewhere**
A slower burn, but important. Show what functioning democracies look like. Show what social safety nets, press freedom, and accountable government actually feel like to live inside. This is not gloating. It is evidence.

## The Curated Creator List

We have assembled a starting list of creators across the US, Canada, Australia, and Europe who are already doing versions of this work and who we believe should know about each other.

→ [View the full creator list](CREATORS.md)

This list is not closed. It is a starting point.

---

## How You Can Participate

**If you are a creator:**
Look through the list. Reach out to someone doing complementary work in another country. Start a conversation. You don't need anyone's permission.

**If you are a regular person:**
Think about the creators you already follow who are doing this kind of work. Share this project with them. Reach out to them directly and ask them to connect with someone on the list. One introduction can start something real.

**If you want to nominate someone for the list:**

We are looking for creators who prioritize accuracy, are willing to collaborate across borders, and understand that this is larger than any single country's politics.

## A Note on Risk

Creators outside the United States who speak critically about what is happening there are not without risk. Data sharing between major platforms and government agencies is already occurring. Travel to the United States can be affected. This is not paranoia. It is the current reality.

Participate thoughtfully. Know your own risk tolerance. Protect your sources.

## This Is Not About Saving Anyone

No country is coming to rescue the United States. That is not how this works, and it would not help if it did.

What international solidarity can do is bear witness, provide perspective, document a record, and remind the people living through this that they are not crazy and they are not alone.

The rest is up to the people on the ground.
